              <h1>Cornafulla Micro Reserve: Community-Led Peatland Conservation in Ireland</h1>
<p>Cornafulla Micro Reserve is a community-led organisation committed to working in partnership with local landowners and the wider community to conserve and manage the natural, cultural, and ecological heritage of Cornafulla Bog. This aligns with both national peatland restoration efforts and the Natura 2000 conservation objectives — a European network of protected sites for biodiversity.</p>
<p>Although large areas of the bog have been historically impacted by drainage and peat extraction, Cornafulla Bog still holds significant ecological value. These include areas of Active Raised Bog (Annex I habitat 7110, a priority under the EU Habitats Directive), Degraded Raised Bog (7120, capable of natural regeneration), and distinctive Rhynchosporion habitats (7150, important for specific plant communities). </p>
<h1>Community, Landowners and Volunteers Supporting Cornafulla Bog</h1>
<p>Our group consists of a dedicated core membership of approximately 12 people, with an extended network of 25 volunteers drawn from local landowners, community members, artists, and researchers. These individuals collaborate to help manage and monitor the ecological health of the bog, offering vital wildlife observations, photographs, and data for ongoing studies. </p>
<p>Several member landowners contribute actively to conservation efforts by allowing the placement of monitoring equipment on their land. This cooperative work supports ecological restoration and enhances our understanding of the bog’s biodiversity. </p>
<p>While we do not own land or carry insurance for private property activities, all work is conducted with the full consent and cooperation of local landowners. </p>
<h1>Peatland Conservation, Wildlife Monitoring and Education Activities</h1>
<p>Cornafulla Micro Reserve plays an active role in peatland conservation and community engagement. Notably, we participate in the International Swan Census, a coordinated count of swan populations across Ireland and the UK, which takes place every six years. We also offer wildlife monitoring workshops in partnership with agri-environment initiatives. </p>
<p>In the coming year, the organisation plans to host a series of bog walks and talks, engaging local farmers, community members, and other interested groups. These events will provide an opportunity for shared learning, constructive discussions, and raising awareness of the climate benefits of peatland restoration. </p>
<p>Though traditional turf cutting remains part of the local culture, there is an increasing recognition within the community of the need for peatland conservation and its role in mitigating climate change. Through collaboration, voluntary work, and strong relationships with government agencies and statutory bodies, we aim to promote long-term peatland stewardship and provide measurable benefits for both nature and people. </p>

<h1>Sharing the Natural and Cultural Heritage of Cornafulla Bog</h1>
<p>Our website serves as a key platform for connecting people with Cornafulla Bog. It highlights the ecology, wildlife, habitats, and cultural history of the bog, and provides accessible information for the community, volunteers, and potential supporters. </p>
<p>The site also features updates on ongoing conservation projects, opportunities for citizen science, and guidance on monitoring activities. By providing these resources, the website fosters a greater sense of connection to the bog and helps further our mission of sustainable, community-led peatland conservation. </p>
<p>We believe that by sharing our work and inviting community participation, we can continue to protect the rich biodiversity and heritage of Cornafulla Bog for future generations. </p>
