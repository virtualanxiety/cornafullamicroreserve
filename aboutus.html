       <p class="hero__description">
                <p>Cornafulla Micro Reserve is a community-led organisation established to work in partnership with local landowners and the wider community to manage, conserve and communicate the natural, cultural and ecological heritage of Cornafulla Bog, in line with national peatland restoration and Natura 2000 conservation objectives (a European network of protected sites for habitats and species). While large areas of the bog have been historically degraded by drainage and peat extraction, it retains significant conservation value, including small areas of Active Raised Bog (Annex I habitat 7110, a priority habitat under the EU Habitats Directive), extensive Degraded Raised Bog capable of natural regeneration (7120, previously damaged bog that can naturally recover over time), and well-developed depressions on peat substrates of the Rhynchosporion (7150, shallow wet hollows on peat supporting specific plant communities).</p>

<p>The group has a core membership of approximately 12 people and can draw on a wider network of around 25 volunteers, including landowners, local community members, artists and researchers. A number of member landowners support conservation by agreement, allowing the careful placement of wildlife, plant and habitat monitoring equipment on their lands and contributing observations and photographs for ecological monitoring. The organisation does not own land or carry insurance for activities on private property, and all work on the bog takes place with the consent and cooperation of local landowners.</p>

<p>Cornafulla Micro Reserve delivers practical conservation and education activities, including participation in the International Swan Census (a coordinated  count of swan populations across Ireland and the UK every 6 years) and wildlife monitoring workshops in partnership with agri-environment initiatives. In the coming year, the organisation aims to host bog walks and talks with the local farming community and other interest groups, supporting shared learning and constructive discussion. While traditional turf cutting remains part of the local landscape, there is growing awareness within the community of the environmental and climate benefits of peatland restoration and conservation. By working collaboratively, keeping costs low through voluntary effort, and engaging constructively with government agencies and statutory bodies, the group promotes long-term peatland stewardship and delivers measurable public benefit for both nature and people.</p>

<h3>Communicating Our Work</h3>
<p>Our website serves as a key platform for sharing the heritage value of Cornafulla Bog, including its ecology, wildlife, habitats, and cultural history. It provides accessible information for the community and volunteers, highlights ongoing conservation projects, and offers guidance for citizen science and monitoring activities. By sharing updates, resources, and opportunities to get involved, the website helps connect people with the bog and supports our mission of long-term peatland stewardship.
