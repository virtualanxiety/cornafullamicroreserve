<p>Tiny red & yellow plant catches my eye on the verge of Cornafulla (Corr na Fola) </p>
<p>in the rough patch of scutch, I squat down, getting a closer look</p>
<p>A clutch of small spreading red stems with multi-headed rosette and petals</p>
<p>No,  mouths with tiny glistening hair-thin teeth open to the light between the shade of grass blades </p>
<p>Aghast at the world or patient and awaiting morsels to drop from the sky </p>
<p>Tongue-coloured landing pad just big enough for annoying persistent buzzing midges</p>
<p>that patrol in the half-lights of the day by the millions, all across the hundreds of acres of this boggy landscape </p>
<p>Awaiting as one Corrmhíol* drops, catching a sweet whiff of aroma floating above the juicy tempting surface </p>
<p>Irresistible - stuck now,  the midge’s legs glued</p>
 
<p>The more they move the more the sticky stuck grabs the legs Then suck,  caught in these primitive traps</p>

<p>Sundew, Drúchtín Móna, Turf dewdrop, Drosera,  Lustwort, Cailís Mhuireann </p>

<p>A spongy holy grail Names laid over like the compressed layers of sphagnum moss & decades, centuries </p>
<p>of seasonal decay - plants, otter pelt strip, bog butter, bronze armlets, torn scrap of leather book-cover </p>
<p>Chipped spear tip, Tochair planks, elk antlers, gnarly long lengths of oak bark</p>

<p>The fine skeletons of chirping larks, snipes, crakes and sonar hunting bats, </p>
<p>buried stone temples & tombs of lost gods, Esker glacial till  & erratics of retreating blue ice-sheets</p>
<p>Down down to the hard pan of impenetrable clays on top of sea-bedded limestones, once swampy bogs too </p>
<p>Lithified, raised, exposed, scraped, crushed crustaceans weird & extinct crinoids, ammonites, trilobites </p>
Over & over  one creature's beauty is another’s executioner is another’s lifesaving meal</p>
<p>Sundew of Cornafulla a dangerous joy</p>
<p>*Corrmhiol - Midge</p>
