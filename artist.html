				<p>The Artist Residency programme <em>By Accident or Design</em> invites poets, artists, and researchers to immerse themselves in the unique habitats of the Cornafulla Micro Reserve. Through deep observation, reflection, and creative engagement with the site’s ecology, participants will develop new work inspired by a landscape shaped by industrial peat extraction and ongoing ecological change. With neither a stable past nor future, the bog defies fixed understanding. Here, knowledge is provisional and ever-evolving, and participants are invited to work within this uncertainty. Every act of observation, creation, and research contributes to the bog’s ongoing transformation—making it clear that the bog is not a subject to be understood, but a living condition that challenges the very process of knowing and questions the limits of certainty.</p>

<p>Tiny red & yellow plant catches my eye on the verge of<br>
	Cornafulla (Corr na fola) </p>
in the rough patch of scutch, I squat down, getting a<br>
			closer look </p>
<p>A clutch of small spreading red stems with multi-headed<br>
	rosette and petals</p>
<p>No,  mouths with tiny glistening hair-thin teeth open to<br>
	the light between the shade of grass blades </p>
<p>Aghast at the world or patient and awaiting morsels<br>
	to drop from the sky </p>
<p>Tongue-red landing pad just big enough for annoying<br>
	persistent buzzing midges. </p>
<p>That patrol in the half-lights of the day by the millions,<br>
	all across the hundreds of acres of this boggy landscape </p>
<p>Awaiting as one Corrmhíol* drops, catching a sweet<br>
	whiff of aroma floating above the juicy tempting surface </p>
<p>Irresistible - stuck now,  the midge’s legs glued 	The <br>
	more they move the more the sticky stuck grabs the legs </p>
<p>Then suck,  caught in these primitive traps, the Sundew, </p>
<p>Drúchtín móna, Turf dewdrop, Drosera,  Lustwort, <br>
	Cailís Mhuireann </p>
<p>A spongy holy grail Names laid over like the compressed <br>
	layers of sphagnum moss & decades, centuries </p>
<p>of seasonal decay - plants, otter pelt strip, Bog butter, <br>
	bronze armlets, torn scrap of leather book-cover </p>
<p>Chipped spear tip Tochair planks Elk antlers gnarly long <br>
	lengths of oak bark </p>
<p>The fine skeletons of chirping larks, snipes. crakes and  <br>
	sonar hunting bats</p>
<p>buried stone temples & tombs of lost gods, Esker glacial <br>
	'till  & erratics of retreating blue ice-sheets, </p>
<p>Down down to the hard pan of impenetrable clays on <br>
	top of sea-bedded limestones, once swampy bogs too </p>
<p>Lithified, raised, exposed, scraped, crushed crustaceans <br>
	weird & extinct crinoids, ammonites, trilobites </p>
<p>Over & over  one creature's beauty is another’s <br>
	executioner is another’s life-saving meal
<p>Sundew of Cornafulla a dangerous joy </p>
<p>
