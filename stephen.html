				<p>Lelia Henry is a visual artist from Coosan, Athlone. She holds an MA in Art & Process from Crawford College of Art, graduating in 2020. She also holds qualifications in drawing from NCAD and the Florence Academy of Art.</p>
<p>She has been awarded the Thomas Dammann Junior Memorial Trust Award twice, and a number of Arts Council Agility Awards. In 2017, she won Irish Landscape Artist of the Year at the National Open Art Competition, London. She has exhibited at the Royal Hibernian Academy of Arts - RHA (where she also studied); The Royal Ulster Academy (RUA); Mall Galleries, London; and Pallant House Gallery, Chichester. She has had a number of solo shows, most recently at the Ashford Gallery, RHA, entitled Conversations with Trees. In 2026, she will take part in a show of contemporary drawing at Luan Gallery, Athlone. Her work is held in numerous collections, public and private, including the OPW State Art Collection.</p>
<p>Her practice is drawing based, working mainly in charcoal. Her work explores neglected and overlooked elements of the rural landscape, examining the relationship between these neglected spaces, and the enduring impact of human activity. Her concern for the loss of the natural world drives her to create meticulously rendered drawings, through which she offers the viewer a quiet space for reflection in which to consider our relationship to our world around us.
