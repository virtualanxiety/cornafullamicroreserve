                <p>Starting out with fairly modest equipment - a few pairs of binocculars, a DSLR camera with a 24-70mm lens and a Browning Spec Ops Elite HP5 trail camera, we have made interesting discoveries and many contributions to the Citizen Science Portal.</p>

				<p><h3>Plans for 2026</h3></p>
				<p>Our three goals for the coming year are (1) to fundraise to purchase a Wildlife Acoustics Song Meter SM4 to make good quality sound recordings of birds and other vocal wildlife, a spotting scope and tripod to use for bird counts and to share bird watching with more of our members, and a few more trail cameras to rotate between plots of land over different seasons.</p>
				
				<p></p>(2) Some of our land owner members are invoved in the Breeding Waders EIP project, and we'll be out hoping to record some of the following:</p>

				  <figcaption>Snipe</figcaption>
  <audio controls src="assets/sounds/Snipe_XC836175.mp3"></audio>
				  <figcaption>Redshank</figcaption>
  <audio controls src="assets/sounds/Redshank_XC741317.mp3"></audio>
				
				
				
				<p>(3) Drawing on the information provided by the Community Wetlands Forum, we're going to get our members involved in
					doing vegetation relevé analysis - a standardized, detailed record of all plant species in a specific, defined plot of vegetation, 
					noting their abundance (cover), vertical structure (layers), location, and environmental factors like soil or slope. 
					It's a semi-quantitative method that relies on 
					estimated cover rather than precise counts, forming the basis for large vegetation databases and habitat mapping 
					like Ireland's 
					<a href="https://biodiversityireland.ie/projects/ivc-classification-explorer/">
						National Vegetation Database. </a>
					Six years after industrial production has ceased its now a good time to see how the bog is rehabilitating and to set a 
					baseline for records over the next number of years.</p>
