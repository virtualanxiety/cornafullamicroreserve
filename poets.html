            <p>
                The Poets in Residence programme invites writers to spend time immersed in the 
                unique habitats of the Cornafulla Micro Reserve. Through observation, reflection, 
                and creative engagement with the site’s ecology, each poet creates new work inspired 
                by this 0.8-acre landscape of mosses, bog cotton, lichens, and winter light.
